    A man and a fawn play together in a garden… <br>
I say to my friend: 'Where did this little one <br>
come from? ' He says: 'From Heaven - perhaps he's<br>
the prophet John come back to me in my loneliness.<br>
I've been blessed with his company. He has no mother<br>
to nurture him so I became his mother, I give him<br>
goat's milk mixed with a spoonful of scented honey<br>
and carry him like a lover's cloud through an oak forest.'<br>
I said to my friend: 'Has he become familiar with<br>
this house of yours, filled with voices and utensils? '<br>
My friend said: 'He even lies in my bed when he's ill.<br>
I become sickly when he does. I hallucinate:<br>
O orphaned child, I'm your father and mother,<br>
get up and teach me tranquility.' I waited one month<br>
before visiting my friend's rural home. And his words<br>
came with tears, strong Solomon wept for the first time,<br>
telling me in a quivering voice:<br>
'This son of the father deer and the mother deer<br>
died in my arms. He couldn't adjust to a domestic life.<br>
But his death isn't like yours or mine.' I said nothing<br>
to my desolate friend. He didn't bid me goodbye<br>
with a recitation of verse, as usual. He walked to the tomb<br>
of the white deer. He gathered sand in his hands<br>
and cried: 'Rise up, my son, so your father can sleep<br>
in your bed - only there can I know tranquility.'<br>
He is asleep in the fawn's grave and I have<br>
a small past in this place…<br>
A man and a fawn lie together in a garden…<br>

    <h1><u>Psalm 3</u></h1>
    On the day when my words <br>
were earth...<br>
I was a friend to stalks of wheat.<br>

On the day when my words<br>
were wrath<br>
I was a friend to chains.<br>
On the day when my words<br>
were stones<br>
I was a friend to streams.<br>
On the day when my words<br>
were a rebellion<br>
I was a friend to earthquakes.<br>
On the day when my words<br>
were bitter apples<br>
I was a friend to the optimist.<br>
But when my words became<br>
honey...<br>
flies covered<br>
my lips! ...<br>

 <p> Al-Haya was swell till I knew of ethnic cleansing..
     turmoil crept into life, when I wasn't 
     of help to my brethren.
     days into months,
     seconds into hours,
     I was the handicapped, whilst they paid
     for someone else's wrongdoing.
     why should they?
     haven't they been sunshine enough,
     now to atone for your jealous greed!
     Know this,
     They'll fight,
     We'll fight,
     I'll fight,
     for God!
     Against:
     The Enemies of Mankind!
